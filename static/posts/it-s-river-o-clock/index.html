          <p><em>This is republished from the XP newsletter for July 2024.</em></p>
<p>Welcome to summer. It’s a rare warm day here in Rotterdam. This is Elliott. I'm here at the studio early, writing this newsletter to you. The fan is going full blast and a tune is playing. For a quick recap... last season on the XP Newsletter, Emma reflected on the 4 Openings and how things are expanding (like the  universe) and that means we need to trust ourselves and each other even more.</p>
<p>The other day we were sitting by the Rotte (the river of Rotterdam) and Ben commented on how the   green algae that had covered  the river the day before had disappeared over night. As the summer days blur together, it feels like we are connecting with the   river more than ever. Most  days we take lunches on the dock near the   river. Sometimes we lie around in the sun near the water. It has become a consistent part of our daily xp-istance. To give you a sense of our experience, here it is represented in clock form...</p>
<figure><img alt="" src="https://d2w9rnfcy7mm78.cloudfront.net/33137211/original_d308b68b7c2dfc63b0ca4742ebe86cf3.jpg"></figure>
<p>Yesterday, during our studio swim, Léa let us borrow her  brat-portal. As I disappeared through the  portal, I thought, I might never be the same once I go through this (in a dramatic tone). When I emerged, everything felt a little different. Were the  greens just a little  greener? It was hard to tell. Wait... have we all aged? As we sat on the dijk near the river, we talked about getting older. What if we don't accomplish our goals? What if we are still dealing with the same setbacks? Would we be okay with that reality, or would we want to go back through the  portal? How do you trust in a process when you don't know the outcome? These questions felt big and serious and I asked if anyone wanted to take another swim.</p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿﻿...speaking of portals let's take a portal through various moments of activity over the last month...</p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p>
<p>﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿</p>
<p>...... XP hosts a  simultaneous football and tennis watching party. Jack is a fan of Jack. Domitille and Quentin join us. It’s nice to see them (and a little surreal after we watched a livestream of them coding their website during construction week).</p>
<p>...... Ben hosts a gaming night (#dorkday) where we play Death Stranding. Colin wonders why every character is introduced with the voice actor’s name. What  beautiful rocks and moss they have in this world. It brings us back to our Vlieland holiday (sans-truffles). There must be some  climbing here, right?  Colin finds several ladders through the mountains. Is this a shortcut? Is this a metaphor?  Kirsten says the baby looks a little like her when she was a baby. The main character looks at the baby and it  smiles back at him. Does our inner-child smile back like this baby?</p>
<p>...We take more lunches outside on the dock (beach). One day, a sailing boat arrives and docks. Two weeks pass, and it doesn't set sail again. One afternoon, two cops come to inspect and board the boat. For a moment, they look like they could be lovers and might set sail.</p>
<p>...... After several weeks of  garden updates from Elliott, Gijs.garden returns from his summer holiday. Gijs  begins his daily post-holiday-post-lunch-vibe-shift reading hour near the Rotte.</p>
<p>..... We  cycle to the windmill to  swim. We observe a swimmer and her dog. The swimmer swims up the river, and the dog runs along the riverbank to meet her. Is this the perfect companion/partner?</p>
<p>....... A painting  atelier forms in the front window. Emma brings in dozens of canvases, and like true artists, we rebel against our medium. The only things that get painted are the easels and the hangboard.</p>
<p>...... Emma’s  birthday! Happy birthday,  Captain  Emma. XP gifts Emma a miniature boat  . Did you hear that we are now a miniature boat rental company? Watch out, neighbors. We contemplate creating a raft from the hundreds of cans our neighbors have accumulated in the backyard. When will they take it away and let e-island rest in peace?</p>
<p>...  Dewi brings a bubble wand to Emma’s  birthday party. It’s beautiful how the wand brings a sense of lightness and play to any conversation. It casts a spell. The bubbles it creates are beautiful. We try to blow them as big as we can and keep them afloat with frantic hand waves and our breath. Elliott contemplates writing the entire newsletter about bubbles. On a train to Amsterdam for  JB's  crepe dinner (merci  JB), Gijs, Emma, and Elliott talk about bubbles in relation to Extra Practice, love, and more.</p>
<p>......... Ben and Elliott orchestrate an  HTML Energy freewrite for HTML Day (July 13). Hunter  (merci) brought a screen to make bootleg shirts. It's a beautiful analogue to the digital. The graphic designers nerd out on the  screen printing, and the programmers nerd out on placing iframes inside iframes. We take turns  sailing up the Rotte in a rented boat. It all feels like a movie  .</p>
<p>..... Emma organizes another tax day work session for Q2. This ThemeWork sesh is  toddler-core themed ﻿﻿﻿and we work on the floor and eat candy and play with  lego﻿﻿. We also screen ﻿Pingu, Thunderbirds, Mr. Rogers﻿ ﻿﻿Neighborhood and other shows from our inner-childhoods.﻿﻿</p>
<p>..... Elliott proposes the newsletter prompt, “What have you learned from love?” but the prompt is too xp-ansive. What does he mean? Is this about romance, platonic love, family, or something else entirely? He seems a bit distracted by his phone book of the internet project he is working on with Kristoffer. Emma says her comic strip just has a bunch of heart shapes.</p>
<p>..... Henk  visits! He is loving life and embracing his age. Did you know our studio wifi password is Henk213!</p>
<p>........ Jack  returns from the UK. He took a swim in the Thames (it's uncertain if he aligned his swim time to the  XP river clock schedule). While in the UK, he went on a research trip with his lad(s) to look into manufacturing for a furniture project (to be announced). He also cooked up a feast for his mother's birthday, featuring lettuce and other dishes. Now that he's  back. He is looking forward to working with Nick on the pizza oven again. Lastly, Jack feels like he is cheating on his two cities, Rotterdam and London, in relation to the old newsletter prompt on love.</p>
<p>.... and to go through yet another portal ..... The last time I wrote this newsletter, I talked about  motion. Rivers are always moving .....</p>        </div>
