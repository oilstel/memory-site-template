          <p><strong>A Complete Unknown</strong><br />
<em>Kino</em><br />
Timtim is in everything! I don't understand why. Is it just the Hollywood machine, or is something nefarious going on here?! He's kind of a terrible actor, or is it that he's in everything, so you can't unsee his characters from past movies? I was also thinking about how people sometimes say I look a little like him. I watched with this in mind and started thinking about how nervous I would be in his place. It feels like every line is so calculated. Anyway, the movie is terrible. Not really a movie, more like a music video. Interesting that Bob Dylan had a motorcycle and a confusing love life. Why was folk so popular? Is it still? It is kind of cool in a weird way.</p>
<p><strong>Severance, 2022</strong><br />
<em>XP, at home</em><br />
I was skeptical at first but got hooked pretty quickly. It's good in the way Lost was. Not sure how they will wrap it up, but will keep watching.</p>
<p><strong>Dreams, 1990</strong><br />
<em>At home</em><br />
I remember starting this movie years ago when I lived in Oakland. It felt too slow at the time and I couldn't finish it. It's nice how it perfectly aligns to my mood today. I love how its literally his dreams as short films. So its more about the dreams he chose to include and the visuals. The peach tree dream is one of my favorites. The costuming in that scene are amazing and this hill with a zigzagging path... really feels like a dream.</p>
<p><strong>Het Zakmes (The Pocket-knife), 1992</strong><br />
<em>XP Kino (Emma)</em><br />
5 stars. Super cute and nice story. Makes me want to learn dutch. Would also like to watch more dutch movies from this time. Feels very progressive for its time. </p>
<p><strong>A Tale of Winter, 1992</strong><br />
<em>At home</em><br />
I didn‚Äôt really love this one. It feels like it‚Äôs trying to do too many things at once, and none of them come through very strongly. It also feels somewhat dated or unaware, especially when it comes to the child and her feelings about the situation and the return of her father. The childs reaction would be more complex. The ending where she mirrors her mother is interesting. It feels very unrealistic in the end: the father returns home, and this ideal vision of him remains. It also comes across as a bit classist at times.¬†I was hoping for some kind of realization: that the father isn't right either. But maybe that‚Äôs the point: she does whatever she wants, even if it means believing in something that is most likely too good to be true.</p>
<p><strong>A Summer's Tale, 1996</strong><br />
<em>At home</em><br />
Really loved this one. The blurring between friend and lover is beautifully portrayed. So many feelings that are not in the open but felt. The musician seems to be so many different men throughout the story. He's a bit annoying at times. I do love this part where he is talking about not being comfortable in groups. Had to stop the film and think about how much I identify with this. So cool to see it portrayed as a reflection, conversation. Feels relatable on many levels. Also, this paradox of being more comfortable as friends than as lovers‚Äîromance sometimes feels fated, whereas friendship involves a choice.</p>
<p><strong>Blue Velvet, 1987</strong><br />
<em>At home (sick)</em><br />
Not much to say. Classic. Maybe not the best film to watch when you are sick. I had a memory of various scenes that didn't actually exist, so that's strange.</p>
<p><strong>Geographies of Solitude, 2022</strong><br />
<em>At home (sick)</em><br />
Feels very scifi. Watching this naturalist inventory micro plastics from around the island. She is looking back at us from the future. The film/sound interludes are really nice in this context. If I saw them outside of the movie I might not appreciate them as much but they weirdly work. Makes me want to live somewhere kinda remote and make spreadsheets of microplastics. Dream job? Also makes me want to paint, collect, make sculpture. Its super sincere‚Äìjust portraying what is happening which makes it very deep. I really appreciate that. Wild how watchable nature can be.</p>
<p><strong>A Tale of Springtime, 1991</strong><br />
<em>At home (sick)</em><br />
So many twisting conversations that my mind can't really follow right now. I like the party scene where they meet and immediately become friends. This feels like such a rare occurrence in life but somehow its still convincing. Things just work out. I like how the older girl feels into the situation. The other characters see her as this bouy of reason and in the next scene she expresses truly how she feels.</p>
<p><strong>Queer, 2024</strong><br />
<em>At home with P</em><br />
Very stylized and felt a bit netflix quality. Realistic portrayal of love and the symbols were interesting though I was thinking, the symbol descriptions in writing are probably more vivid and meaningful. Lots of music. At one point I was thinking if its a music video lol. Haven't thought about Burroughs since school and it makes me want to read something by him.</p>
<p><strong>Babygirl, 2024</strong><br />
<em>Kino, Rotterdam</em><br />
Very similar to this Love and Anarchy tv series. Felt like a mashup of every trend right now. Definitely was think tanked. Too careful. Felt like sex scenes were realistic‚Äìnot trying to hide things for the viewer which is cool but maybe would be bold 10 years ago.</p>
<p><strong>Matrix, 1999</strong><br />
<em>At home in Rotterdam with P</em><br />
Still so good. Perfect movie. Story is so to the point. Every shot feels necessary. Nothing like it.</p>
<p><strong>Nosferatu, 1979</strong><br />
<em>At XP for the first screening</em><br />
Love this movie so much. Very theatrical and so beautiful. A strange blend of kitschy acting and immensely beautiful misty scenes. Dracula running through the square in all black trying to find a rave haha. I also love how Dracula isn't really a villan or at least hesitates when he is drinking her blood at the end. His character feels more nuanced than in the new movie. Deeply romantic. Also such a covert romance between dracula and the messenger.</p>
<p><strong>The Conversation, 1974</strong><br />
<em>Kino, Rotterdam</em><br />
Wow haven't seen this in ages but saw the poster outside kino and thought it was good when Michael told me about and i watched it in SF. Still so nostalgic for SF. The interior of his apartment is so much like the 43 Juniper place. Idk though I think my taste is in a bit of a different place right now. Its still so well thought out.</p>
<p><strong>A Real Pain, 2024</strong><br />
<em>Kino, Rotterdam</em><br />
Surprisingly good for a bad trailer. Acting is insanely good but also maybe they are just playing themselves. Lots of layers of ego/reflection, seeing yourself/your flaws in another. Makes me want to visit Poland.</p>
<p><strong>All About My Mother, 1999 üîÅ</strong><br />
<em>At home, Rotterdam</em><br />
Still need to finish...</p>
<p><strong>The Room Next Door, 2024</strong><br />
<em>Kino, Rotterdam</em><br />
Super boring slow pretentious start. Okay you are rich and live in Greenwich Village and have a key to Gramercy Park. After they leave the city it gets more interesting. Checking the red door each morning is an interesting narrative device. Keeps you watching. Hopper deck chair scene is kinda over the top. Julianne Moore carries it. The ending is interesting and overall good topic that is not in the spotlight often. We should probably think about death and dying more</p>
<p><strong>Nosferatu, 2024</strong><br />
Very hollywood. A bit Tim Burton lol. I like the shot of the hand casting a shadow over the city. It brought back memories of the Herzog version. Could have been more playful. Also such a missed opportunity to make it more queer. No sexual energy between Dracula and the messenger and what is there is so basic. I guess part of the reason I don't like horror.</p>        </div>
