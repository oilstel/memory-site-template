Title: Water glass theory of websites

----

Page-content:

Entering the studio in the morning, I find water glasses on the big table––reminders of the activity that took place yesterday.

Sites are beacons, presence indicators that tell others we are here, situated in the cities or the mountains. When we overlay these sites, we sometimes find similarities.

The sites we visit day to day are often very visual, but what if we just treated them as markers?

Looking back on the websites I've made, it really seems like their mere existence allowed for bridges to form. I realized the other day that my initial connection to a collective I visited last month can be traced back to a website I built 5 years ago.

Someone was here. Someone took the time to come up with this domain name and host it. What were they feeling at the time? What else was happening in their life? Were they in love?

Sites become these timestamps from various people's lives––a bunch of glasses scattered around the table from the day before.
