Title: Chance brush

----

Page-content:

In February 2022, I asked (link: https://taichi.pink/ text: Taichi Aritomo) to suggest names for a new company I wanted to start. Out of the names he proposed, I chose "Chance Brush." I like how it evokes a brush with the universe. It feels a little spiritual.

## Chance Brush guiding words:
*Movement
Chance
Relation
Event*
