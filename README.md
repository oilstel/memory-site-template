# memory site template

this is a template for creating your own memory site üçäüí¨

### what is a memory site

- mostly written for oneself, leaning more towards a diary than a blog
- a way of documenting experiences, memories, ideas, and realizations
- contains both short and long form writing

### about this memory site

this memory site template is a fork of elliott's memory.elliott.computer site[1]. every post holds the same weight. it is loosely inspired by the zettelkasten system[2], are.na[3], zinzy.website[4], and piper haywood's[5] website. you can read more about my interest in memory sites on my memory site[6].

### customization

i also think designing or customizing the cms is part of what makes memory sites useful on a personal level. they reflect how the writer thinks and sees the world. they are more than just the viewable portion.

### how to use this template

the hope is that this memory site can be used as a starter template so that you don't have to start from scratch. feel free to use the parts that work for you and remove the parts that don't.

## technical information

### cms

a content management system or cms for short allows you to publish to your website without having to work with html directly. often this is useful when you are working with a client where they operate in a "no-code bubble" ü´ß. this memory site uses kirby cms [1]. kirby is a cms that uses php to create "flat files" of your data. in this instance, kirby builds a static site that you can publish on the www.

### using the static site generator

on most pages in the cms, you'll see a "generate a static version of the site" button. it uses a kirby plugin called "static site generator."[1] by clicking this it will generate your entire site as a static (html, css, js) website in `/static`. you can upload your static site using ftp or to github pages.

### using kirby on a server

it is also possible to run kirby directly on a server (without the static site generator). it is a bit more setup and depends a lot on which server you are using. this is not covered here. using kirby directly on a server will allow you to publish more instantly to your live website, login from any computer, and also create user accounts that can be shared.
